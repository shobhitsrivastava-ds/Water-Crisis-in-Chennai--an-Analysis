# Water-Crisis-in-Chennai--an-Analysis
Chennai also known as Madras is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Located on the Coromandel Coast off the Bay of Bengal, it is the biggest cultural, economic and educational centre of south India.

Being my second home, the city is facing an acute water shortage now (June 2019). Chennai is entirely dependent on ground water resources to meet its water needs. There are four reservoirs in the city, namely, Red Hills, Cholavaram, Poondi and Chembarambakkam, with a combined capacity of 11,057 mcft. These are the major sources of fresh water for the city.

Apart from the reservoirs, the other sources of fresh water water are desalination plants at Nemelli and Minjur; aquifers in Neyveli, Minjur and Panchetty; Cauvery water from Veeranam lake;

Here is an attempt to put together a dataset that has the information about the various water sources available in the city.
